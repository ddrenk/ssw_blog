To start off I would like to say that the paper NeMe: Trouble at the Interface 2.0 by Erkki Huhtamo is highly technical and dry, with a lot of good references and their explanations, but not a lot of iteration on the actual substance of interactive art.  I would agree more with the paper if it presented the introduction of interactive art as an evolving reaction to stable or traditional viewing art than just explaining views of what the connection of interactive art is on the psyche of the involved "viewer" and conceptual artist. Yes I agree with the paper and its statements about personal and third party interaction, both physical and mental, but it builds it in such a dry and academic way that it makes the paper boring and hard to follow, almost like a textbook or manual although such is the substance of an academic paper in itself.

Although interesting points are given, especially the connection presented between interactive art and the ontological place it has in contemporary art, I believe that the connection is much simpler and systemic. Over the past 20 years technology has exploded and we have already gone through a personal and social revolution with it, and are on the event horizon of another revolution now. Through this revolution of technology came a whole new way to interact on a global level socially via technology. When I say that the connection is much simpler and systemic I mean from this technological and social revolution came with it, and helped build, a philosophical shift in the way contemporary art could be created and viewed. This viewing, through social media and technological invention and interaction, came interactive art and the birth of, essentially, opening up the experience of art from the boundaries of the internal imagination and reality and forcing this to spill into the view of the artist and people interacting with the art.

This public display is paramount and raw to me, almost creating a forceful bond with the person/s who decide to interact with art created for the purpose of drawing out emotions and thoughts. Art for the sake of art is bland and a dead language to me. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next five years as people become more familiar with this concept of immediate response to contemporary art through interactivity. I look forward to being on observer, creator and purveyor of this primal connection and complex shift in contemporary art.
